# Security and privacy

OpenMRI is a single-user desktop application. The server binds to
`127.0.0.1` only, has no authentication, and must not be exposed to a network.
Do not put it behind a reverse proxy, a tunnel, or a port forward.

## Online demo

The online demo (`docs/online/README.md`) is a separate static build, not this
server. It contains only the demo study and the lessons, has no import and no
server code, and its Content Security Policy allows connections only to its
own site. Report problems with it the same way as with the app.

## Medical data

Everything you import stays in your data directory (`.openmri/` by default).
OpenMRI never uploads images, DICOM headers, or patient details anywhere and
makes no network requests while running.

The only scan in the repository is the demo study in `demo/`, published with
the consent of the person scanned. Its headers were reduced to geometry; the
face was left in on purpose. See [demo/README.md](demo/README.md). The banner and the intro clip are generated
illustrations, and the tests build synthetic DICOM and NIfTI data.

When you report a problem, never attach real scans, DICOM headers, worker
logs with patient names, screenshots that show patient details, or your
`library.sqlite`. Reproduce the problem with the synthetic data from the tests,
or anonymise everything first.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Report security issues privately through **Security → Report a vulnerability**
on the GitHub repository page. Do not open a public issue for them. You will get
an answer within a week.

Anything that would let a web page reach the local server, read files outside
the data directory, or execute code through an imported archive is in scope.
