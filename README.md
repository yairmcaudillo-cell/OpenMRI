## What it does

|                         |                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **3D volume rendering** | Three palettes, a movable cut plane, and the slice planes drawn inside the volume.                                                                           |
| **Three linked slices** | Click a slice to place a focus marker that stays visible through the volume. Scroll to move through the stack.                                               |
| **Compare two series**  | Two series of one study side by side, with cursors linked in physical millimetres.                                                                           |
| **Patient library**     | Several patients and study dates in a local SQLite catalogue, with a cache of prepared NIfTI volumes.                                                        |
| **Focus over time**     | Mark a region on one date; other dates of the same head MRI are rigidly registered to it. Compare side by side, with a wipe, or by blinking between A and B. |
| **Welcome screen**      | Your five most recent studies one click away, next to the import wizard. Opening a study plays a short transition while the volume loads.                    |
| **Snapshots**           | PNG snapshots of the current view, saved into your data directory.                                                                                           |
| **Learning mode**       | Neuroanatomy and MRI lessons on the demo study, with an undergraduate and a medical-student track, a glossary and quizzes. See below.                        |

OpenMRI is a visualization tool. It does not detect, measure, or diagnose anything.

## Learning mode

On the demo study, **Learn** opens lessons for students: pick the
undergraduate or the medical-student track, click a landmark and the three
slices and the 3D marker move to it, read definitions of terms in place, and
test yourself with find-it and multiple-choice quizzes. Two lessons compare
T1, T2 and FLAIR side by side. All content is a **draft until a medical
reviewer checks it**, and the app marks it so.

[docs/learning-mode/README.md](docs/learning-mode/README.md) has the guide
and screenshots; [AUTHORING.md](docs/learning-mode/AUTHORING.md) explains
how to write and review lessons. Learning mode was added in this fork by Yair
([@yairmcaudillo-cell](https://github.com/yairmcaudillo-cell)); OpenMRI itself
is by Maksim Khuzin.

## Requirements

- macOS or Linux. Windows works through WSL.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 22.13 or newer.
- Python 3.12, 3.13, or 3.14. On macOS: `brew install python@3.12`.
- A browser with WebGL 2.

The DICOM converter `dcm2niix` is installed automatically into the project's Python
environment by `npm run setup`.

## Quick start

Each way below installs OpenMRI on your computer, loads a demo study, and opens the app in your browser. Click Jane under Recent studies to
open the study. The first run downloads about 1 GB and
takes a few minutes.

### Ask your AI coding agent

Paste this into Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, or any agent that can run commands
on your computer:

```text
Clone https://github.com/lev1nson/OpenMRI, follow its AGENTS.md to install
and start it with the demo study, and open it in my browser.
```

[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) gives the agent the exact steps.

### One command in the terminal

On macOS or Linux:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lev1nson/OpenMRI/main/install.sh | bash
```

On macOS the script installs missing Node.js, Python, and Git with Homebrew,
and asks before installing Homebrew itself. On Linux it lists what to install
first. The app goes into `~/OpenMRI`. Run the same command again to update.

### By hand

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lev1nson/OpenMRI.git
cd OpenMRI
npm run demo    # install, build, start in the background, load the demo, open the browser
```

`npm run demo` runs the individual steps for you: `npm ci`, `npm run setup` for
the Python environment with pydicom, nibabel, SimpleITK, and dcm2niix, and
`npm run build`. On macOS you can also double-click `Launch OpenMRI.command`,
which runs the server in a Terminal window instead.

### Starting and stopping

```sh
npm run up       # start in the background and open the browser
npm run down     # stop
npm run status   # running or not, with the log location
```

The server listens only on `127.0.0.1`. It is a single-user desktop app with no
login, so do not expose the port to a network.

## The demo study

`demo/jane-head-mri.zip` holds one real head MRI session: 18 series,
about 45 MB. `npm run demo` loads it as patient Jane. To load it by hand, click
**Import MRI**, choose that file, name the patient **Jane**, and click
**Prepare the study**. The headers carry no personal details. The face was
left in on purpose, so the 3D view shows a whole head.
[demo/README.md](demo/README.md) describes the series and how they were
prepared.

## Importing your scans

1. Click **Import MRI** and choose a ZIP archive up to 2 GB. It can contain DICOM
   files in any folder layout, or `.nii` / `.nii.gz` files.
2. OpenMRI extracts the archive, reads the DICOM headers, and shows what it found:
   patient details from the headers, study dates, and the series.
3. Create a new patient or add the study to an existing one, then click
   **Prepare the study**. Conversion runs in the background; you can close the
   wizard and come back through **Library**.
4. Open the study. Volumes are cached, so later opens are instant.

Each archive must contain a single patient. Several study dates in one archive are
fine. Scalar 3D volumes and ordinary 2D MR/CT slice stacks are converted. 4D time
series, single images, color secondary captures, PDFs, and nested ZIPs are skipped
and listed as warnings. See [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md) for
the import pipeline, the storage layout, and every viewer control.

## Where your data lives

Everything is stored under `.openmri/` next to the app. Set `OPENMRI_DATA_DIR` to
move it.

| Path             | Contents                                              |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `library.sqlite` | Patients, studies, series metadata, import jobs       |
| `sources/`       | Original ZIP archives, named by SHA-256               |
| `volumes/`       | Prepared NIfTI volumes, downsampled to ≤320 px/axis   |
| `registrations/` | Rigid transforms and resampled volumes for comparison |
| `jobs/`          | Import drafts and worker logs                         |
| `captures/`      | PNG snapshots you saved                               |

`.openmri/` and `.venv/` are ignored by Git. Never commit the data directory.
It contains medical images and personal details.

## Development

```sh
npm run dev          # dev server on 127.0.0.1:4173
npm run lint         # oxlint
npm run typecheck    # tsc
npm test             # Node tests: focus controller, slice planes, timeline service, contracts
npm run test:import  # Python tests: ZIP import, real dcm2niix conversion, registration
npm run format       # oxfmt
npm run check        # lint, typecheck, the Node tests and lessons:check together
npm run lessons:check  # learning-mode lessons: structure, text per track, review rules
npm run test:e2e     # browser tests on the demo study (after npm run build)
npm run gate         # everything above plus the build, stopping at the first failure
```

The Python tests generate synthetic DICOM and NIfTI data. One of them imports the
demo archive end to end.

Rendering is done by [NiiVue](https://niivue.com), DICOM conversion by
[dcm2niix](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix), registration by
[SimpleITK](https://simpleitk.org).

## Limitations

- Automatic registration is offered for head MRI only: DICOM body part `HEAD` or
  `BRAIN`, or NIfTI imports, which carry no body part. Other body parts import and
  display normally but cannot be compared across dates yet.
- Registration is rigid, rotation and translation only. It is an initial estimate,
  not a clinically validated alignment. Always check landmarks yourself.
- Series within one study share scanner coordinates. Motion between series is not
  corrected.
- Contrast tags come from DICOM metadata only. OpenMRI never infers contrast from
  image brightness and does not compute difference maps.
- No analysis model is connected. `lib/analysis-contract.ts` defines the adapter
  interface a local model would have to satisfy.
